    **Proompty API Documentation For Developers**


    **Proompty** is an advanced **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** API
    designed to empower users in seamlessly integrating their data and
    harnessing the power of customized **Large Language Model (LLM)** prompts
    for interactive communication. At its core, Proompty operates through a
    series of interconnected functionalities that enable users to navigate and
    manipulate their data effectively.


    The API offers a multifaceted approach to content organization through the
    creation of **Topics**, which serve as thematic containers for related
    information. Within these Topics, users can craft **Agents** tailored to
    their specific needs, leveraging the rich capabilities of LLMs to generate
    contextually relevant responses.


    Additionally, Proompty supports the uploading of documents, enriching the
    content repository with valuable information that can be referenced and
    queried during interactions. These documents enhance the AI's understanding
    of the topic and facilitate more informed responses to user inquiries.


    One of the standout features of Proompty is its chat functionality, which
    allows users to engage in dynamic conversations with the AI-powered Prompt
    system. By submitting messages or binary streams to designated prompts
    within selected topics, users can elicit responses that draw upon the
    accumulated knowledge base, providing valuable insights and facilitating
    productive exchanges.


    In essence, Proompty offers a comprehensive ecosystem for data-driven
    communication, enabling users to create, organize, and interact with content
    in a manner that is both intuitive and highly customizable. Whether it's
    crafting bespoke prompts, uploading documents, or engaging in chat-based
    interactions, the API empowers users to harness the full potential of their
    data in driving meaningful conversations and uncovering valuable insights.
